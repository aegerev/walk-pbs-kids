## The Profit: Top 20 Profitable Companies
The Profit is an American documentary-style reality television show broadcast on CNBC. In each episode, Marcus Lemonis typically offers a capital investment and his expertise to struggling small businesses in exchange for an ownership stake in the company, but a series of "Inside Look" episodes have commentary by Lemonis and executive producer Amber Mazzola as they watch past episodes. Some episodes simply show a business, city, or industry without any investment by Lemonis.

## ACTIVITY
While the activity is based on the show "The Profit", the key lies in computer programming. More specifically, the file 'walk-the-profit.js'. That file is divided into 2 tasks:
* TASK 1: For this task, I worked in the createSortedTable array. This task is crucial as I needed to sort the profitData array. I had to base the sorting on the ‘TOTAL EARNINGS’ property, with the employee with the highest earnings at the top (descending order). JavaScript’s array ‘sort’ function was instrumental here.
The sort function is an Array manipulation function, which uses a function as an argument. In the inner function, two parameters, a and b, represent two consecutive elements in that array. In this case, i had to ensure that the value returned is the difference between the total earnings of a and b (a - b). Remember that the total earnings are strings; therefore, I had to parse them into numbers first.
* The second task required more complex data processing. I had to w in the function named calculateAverageSalary. This function should be versatile, accepting two parameters: an array and a number (n). The purpose is to calculate and return the average salary of the dataset’s top “n” earners, allowing for data analysis flexibility.
