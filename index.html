	<h1>Walk The Profit Assignment</h1>
	<p>The Profit is an American documentary-style reality television show broadcast on CNBC. In each episode, Marcus Lemonis typically offers a capital investment and his expertise to struggling small businesses in exchange for an ownership stake in the company, but a series of "Inside Look" episodes have commentary by Lemonis and executive producer Amber Mazzola as they watch past episodes. Some episodes simply show a business, city, or industry without any investment by Lemonis.</p>

	<br/> <br/> 

	<p>Let's see how much each company earned during the course of the entire show.</p>
